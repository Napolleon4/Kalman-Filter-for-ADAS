The purpose of the simulation is to follow the vehicles in traffic with different sensors and predict their next situation through the Kalman Filter. If the anticipated situations create a dangerous situation, the vehicle brakes independently of the driver. 

In this way, the vital importance of the ADAS System is observed.

Automated Driving Toolbox, Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox and Navigation Toolbox were used for the simulation.

The scenario was created using Driving Scenario Designer.




Run the Main.m file to start the simulation. 
Do not pay attention to the warnings that appear in the Command Window as the vehicles are intertwined in the accident simulation (Scenario function).

The Scenario() function was written to simulate the moment of the accident, and the ADAS() function was written to simulate the automatic braking system.


Sensors measure 10 times in 1 second. Kalman Filter was used to estimate the current position of vehicles at 1 second and prevent the accident.
